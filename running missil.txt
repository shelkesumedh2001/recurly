● 🚀 Complete Guide to Running & Testing Recurly During Development

  📋 Initial Setup (One-Time Only)

  Step 1: Verify Flutter Installation

  flutter doctor

  What to check:
  - ✅ Flutter SDK installed
  - ✅ Android toolchain (for Android development)
  - ✅ At least one device/emulator available
  - ⚠️ Ignore web/iOS if you're focusing on Android

  Step 2: Install Dependencies

  cd /home/sumedh/app
  flutter pub get

  What this does: Downloads all packages from pubspec.yaml

  Step 3: Generate Code (CRITICAL!)

  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

  What this does: Generates Hive type adapters (*.g.dart files)

  You'll see files created:
  - lib/models/subscription.g.dart
  - lib/models/enums.g.dart

  🎯 Running the App

  Option 1: Default Run (Recommended for Development)

  flutter run

  Features:
  - ✅ Hot reload enabled (press r)
  - ✅ Hot restart enabled (press R)
  - ✅ Debug mode with full error messages
  - ✅ Fast compilation
  - ⚠️ Slower app performance (expected in debug mode)

  Option 2: Run on Specific Device

  # List all available devices
  flutter devices

  # Example output:
  # Android SDK built for x86 (emulator-5554) • emulator-5554 • android-x86 • Android 12 (API 31)
  # Chrome (chrome) • chrome • web-javascript • Google Chrome 120.0

  # Run on specific device
  flutter run -d emulator-5554

  Option 3: Release Mode (Test Performance)

  flutter run --release

  Use when:
  - Testing real performance (animations, scrolling)
  - Testing Material You dynamic colors
  - Preparing for production

  Note: No hot reload in release mode!

  Option 4: Profile Mode (Performance Testing)

  flutter run --profile

  Use when:
  - Profiling performance
  - Finding performance bottlenecks
  - Testing with observatory/DevTools

  🔥 Hot Reload During Development

  What is Hot Reload?

  Hot reload lets you see code changes instantly without restarting the app!

  How to Use:

  1. Make a UI change (change text, colors, add widgets)
  2. Press r in terminal OR Save file (if using VS Code with auto-reload)
  3. See changes instantly (in ~1 second)

  Example Workflow:

  // lib/screens/home_screen.dart
  Text('Monthly Total')  // Original

  // Change to:
  Text('Total This Month')

  // Press 'r' → See change immediately!

  When Hot Reload Works:

  - ✅ UI changes (widgets, layouts, colors)
  - ✅ Text changes
  - ✅ Adding new widgets
  - ✅ Changing widget properties
  - ✅ Updating provider logic (sometimes)

  When You Need Hot Restart (Press R):

  - 🔄 Changing main() function
  - 🔄 Adding new files
  - 🔄 Changing enums
  - 🔄 Changing global variables
  - 🔄 Adding new dependencies

  When You Need Full Restart (Stop & Run Again):

  - 🛑 Changing models with @HiveType
  - 🛑 Running build_runner (generating code)
  - 🛑 Updating pubspec.yaml
  - 🛑 Changing native code (Android/iOS)

  🖥️ Setting Up Emulator/Device

  Option 1: Android Emulator (Recommended)

  Create an emulator in Android Studio:

  1. Open Android Studio
  2. Tools → Device Manager
  3. Create Device → Select phone (Pixel 6 recommended)
  4. Select system image (API 33 - Android 13 for best Material You support)
  5. Finish

  Start emulator:

  # From Android Studio: Click play button on device
  # OR from terminal:
  flutter emulators
  flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>

  Option 2: Physical Android Device

  1. Enable Developer Options:
    - Go to Settings → About Phone
    - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
  2. Enable USB Debugging:
    - Settings → Developer Options
    - Enable "USB Debugging"
  3. Connect via USB:
  # Verify device is connected
  flutter devices
  4. Run app:
  flutter run

  Option 3: Wireless Debugging (Android 11+)

  1. Enable Wireless Debugging in Developer Options
  2. Pair device:
  adb pair <IP:PORT>
  # Enter pairing code from phone
  3. Connect:
  adb connect <IP:PORT>
  flutter run

  🧪 Development Testing Workflow

  Daily Development Routine:

  # 1. Start your day
  cd /home/sumedh/app
  flutter run

  # 2. Make changes to code
  # ... edit files in VS Code/Android Studio ...

  # 3. See changes
  # Press 'r' for hot reload
  # Press 'R' for hot restart

  # 4. If you changed models/enums
  # Stop app (press 'q')
  dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  flutter run

  # 5. End of day
  # Press 'q' to quit

  Testing New Features:

  # 1. Create feature branch (good practice)
  git checkout -b feature/notifications

  # 2. Run app in debug mode
  flutter run

  # 3. Test feature thoroughly
  # - Add subscriptions
  # - Test edge cases
  # - Check error handling

  # 4. Run in release mode to test performance
  flutter run --release

  # 5. Check for issues
  flutter analyze
